**Editing textfiles for money since 1998**

During the day, I provide utility for the development teams at [Autotrader](http://www.autotrader.co.uk) in
Manchester, where we try not to suck at building small service oriented architectures in Java.

At night I study functional languages and use up the worlds dwindling stock of parentheses writing
lisp. I also have children, who use me as indentured labour in Minecraft.
